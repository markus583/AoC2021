# Advent of Code 2021
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that
be solved in any programming language you like.
I chose to use Python.
<br>
One programming puzzle per day is released from 1st to 25th December, 
divided in two parts (the second is unlocked after solving the first). Each correct solution provides a "Star".
<br>
Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), and is 100% free.
